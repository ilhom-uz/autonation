                            I worked at Ucell, TeliaSonera Group, which operates in seventeen countries for almost 5 years.
                            I played active role in integration of IBM Maximo and Netcool Project(Fault and Asset Management) for Ucell.
                            Fault and Asset Management project, which was developed mostly under my scope, is very
                            valuable and important for company performance. I started my career as Junior Engineer
                            and in 3 years I became Senior Engineer and Team Head of Fault and Asset Management Project.
